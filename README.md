# ðŸ“ˆ One-Step-Ahead Option Pricing & Explainability (TSLA)

This is a Streamlit app that predicts the **next-day price of a European call option** on **TSLA** using:

- A **CNN-Attention MLP**
- A structured **Informer + Kolmogorovâ€“Arnold Network (KAFIN)**
- A benchmark **GARCH + Black-Scholes** model

The app also provides **PDP (Partial Dependence Plots)** and **SHAP feature importances** to help interpret model behavior.

## ðŸ§  Project Motivation

The goal is to answer:
> "If I hold or buy an option today, is it worth keeping until tomorrow?"

Using 20 days of real TSLA data from `yfinance`, the app predicts the **next-day price** of a user-defined option contract. It computes **realized volatility** as a proxy for implied volatility and supports three types of models for side-by-side evaluation.

## ðŸš€ Running the App

### âœ… Step 1: Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ryan9dai/XAI_Project_App.git
cd XAI_Project_App
### âœ… Step 2: Install dependencies
Recommended: Use a virtual environment.

python -m venv XAIvenv

source XAIvenv/bin/activate  # On Windows: XAIvenv\Scripts\activate

pip install torch yfinance numpy pandas matplotlib shap scipy arch

### âœ… Step 3: Run the app
streamlit run app.py
Streamlit will open the app in your browser automatically. If not, go to http://localhost:8501.

## ðŸ“Š Example Input Parameters
After fetching the most recent 20 days of TSLA data, you can specify any in-the-money or at-the-money call option (as that's what the model was trained on). Here are a few valid examples:

### âœ… Example 1: Slightly In-The-Money, Short-Term
Strike: 235

Time to Maturity: 0.1

Risk-Free Rate: 0.015

Expected behavior: price close to intrinsic value, relatively low sensitivity to volatility.

### âœ… Example 2: At-The-Money, Medium-Term
Strike: 240

Time to Maturity: 0.25

Risk-Free Rate: 0.015

Expected behavior: highly sensitive to implied volatility and time to maturity. Great for SHAP/PDP insights.

### âœ… Example 3: Deep In-The-Money, Medium-Term
Strike: 200

Time to Maturity: 0.3

Risk-Free Rate: 0.015

Expected behavior: model should price it close to S âˆ’ K, with minimal time value.

### ðŸ“Œ Notes
Realized Volatility is used as a proxy for IV at inference.

Only call options are supported (European-style).

The app does not support historical IV surfaces, so inferred volatility is a simplified estimate.

Models were trained on TSLA options from 2019â€“2022, using ATM and ITM calls only.

## ðŸ§  XAI Features
### âœ… MLP Model:
SHAP (Gradient Ã— Input): Shows which features contributed most to price

PDP: Explore how changing 1 feature affects predicted price (e.g., strike, TTM, IV)

### âœ… Informer+KAFIN Model:
Structured pricing head inspired by Kolmogorovâ€“Arnold decomposition

PDP available for interpretability

SHAP not available due to model structure
